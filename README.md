# Mr Robogers

#### Author: *David Couch*

#### *This web app is designed to receive and input from a user and return a sentence of what a Mr Robogers would have to say about it!*

## Description  
This is a web application with logic written in javascript. The app should take an input from the user and produce an output that changes as the numbers ascend from low to high by using a loop. The ascended increments are set to the value of 1.

While the numbers ascend values change as such:
Values that contain a 1: all digits are replaced with "Beep!"\
Values that contain a 2: all digits are replaced with "Boop!"\
Values that contain a 3: all digits are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"\

The conditions will also take on a role of importance and values containing a 3 will take over conditions with a 2, and so on to 1.
