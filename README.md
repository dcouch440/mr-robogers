# Mr Robogers

#### Author: *David Couch*

#### *This web app is designed to receive and input from a user and return what a Mr Robogers robot would have to say about it!*

* * *
## *Description*
This is a web application with logic written in javascript. The app should take an input from the user and produce an output that changes as the numbers ascend from low to high starting at 0 by using a loop . The ascended increments are set to the value of 1.

While the numbers ascend values change as such:\
Values that contain a 1: all digits are replaced with "Beep!"\
Values that contain a 2: all digits are replaced with "Boop!"\
Values that contain a 3: all digits are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"

The conditions will also take on a role of importance and values containing a 3 will take over conditions with a 2, and so on to 1.

* * *
## *Specs*
```javascript
Describe: robogersTalk()
Test: "It should return an array with a 0 if the number 0 is passed as an argument"
Expect(robogersTalk(0).toEqual([0]))

Test: "It should return an array with 3 values if the number 2 is passed as an argument"
Expect(robogersTalk(2).toEqual([0, "Beep!", "Boop!"]))


Test: "It should return an array with 4 values if the number 3 is passed as an argument"
Expect(robogersTalk(3).toEqual([0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"]))

Test: "It should return an array with 14 values if the number 13 is passed as an argument"
Expect(robogersTalk(0).toEqual([0, "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, "Beep!", "Beep!", "Boop!", "Won't you be my neighbor?"]))

* Click on the code button to open the menu.\
![Github Repo Example](/img/README/HTTPS.PNG)

- Copy the HTTPS code by clicking the clipboard next to the link.

- Within your Bash terminal navigate to your desired location by using cd fallowed by your desired directory.

```

<div 
  style="
    background-color: #d1ecf1; 
    color: grey; padding: 6px; 
    font-size: 9px; 
    border-radius: 5px; 
    border: 1px solid #d4ecf1; 
    margin-bottom: 12px"
> 
  <span 
    style="
      font-size: 12px; 
      font-weight: 600; 
      color: #0c5460;"

  </span>
  <span 
    style="
      font-size: 12px; 
      font-weight: 900; 
      color: #0c5460;
      margin-bottom: 24px"
  >
    Note : 
  </span> 
  If you have any problems make sure your HTTPS code is correct! The example above might not be the most recent HTTPS code!
</div>


* Then after the process is completed use the command.

``` bash
code .
```
* This will open the directory in your default code editor and from there it is required that you open the index.html file from live server or your code editors counterpart. You must use this method. Opening this web app from the index.html file alone will cause it to not function correctly!
